# Route-Tracing-Rover
Arduino-based line-following robot: autonomously navigates predefined paths using sensors to detect and track lines, programmed for precise motion control.



DETAILS
A line-following robot with Arduino is a small, programmable robot that uses infrared sensors or other types of sensors to detect and follow lines on a surface. It typically consists of a chassis with motors, wheels, a microcontroller (such as an Arduino board), and sensors mounted underneath. The sensors continuously read the surface below and send signals to the microcontroller, which then processes the data and adjusts the speed and direction of the motors to stay on the line. This type of robot is commonly used in educational settings to teach concepts of robotics, programming, and sensor integration.
